| **Initial Thoughts** | I would say I was already mostly convinced that the utility of most news was negative. I did indeed think that 'news' as a genre, particularly online, social media and radio acquired news was unentertaining entertainment. I would say I had the opinion that if something was important I'd most likely either hear about it by WoM or in a book with a couple of years delay. I did not think this opinion was very reputable e.g. it didn't cast me in a good light, or worthy of a manifesto. Hence when I saw Rob read the book I thought it was an interesting that the author made not reading the news a point to make a virtue of.  |
| **Full Notes** | # Stop Reading the News - Rolf Dobelli by Rolf Dobelli<br>
* Notes from: July 05, 2023 - July 09, 2023<br>
---<br>
<br>
* Engage with content that is truly relevant and overlaps with your circle of competence. -- [loc 298]<br>
<br>
* ‘Know your circle of competence and stick within it. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.’ -- [loc 438]<br>
<br>
> Circle of compotence... Running, teaching, porgramming -- [loc 439]<br>
<br>
* Over the course of your life you will modify your circle of competence. You may even add extra areas of interest. In these cases, creating a deep knowledge base by reading textbooks and completing online courses, reading long articles and talking to people in the know is imperative. -- [loc 446]<br>
<br>
> Widening the circle -- [loc 448]<br>
<br>
* News corporations and consumers both fall prey to the same mistake, confusing the presentation of facts with insight into the functional context of the world. ‘Facts, facts and more facts’: this is the marginalising credo of nearly all news corporations. -- [loc 559]<br>
<br>
> Facts explain very little -- [loc 561]<br>
<br>
* News reports are often sold as ‘analysis’, when in fact they’re merely anecdotes. Resist the temptation to explain the world so cheaply. You’re holding yourself back from real, serious reflection – and robbing yourself of your only chance to understand the world at least fractionally better. -- [loc 704]<br>
<br>
> Juzt factsvfacts facts -- [loc 706]<br>
<br>
* Those who set the agenda wield power over the discussion. If you let news journalists decide what you should think about, you’re giving them far too much power over your life. Surely you, dear reader, would rather be in the cockpit? Don’t hand over the controls to a bunch of stressed-out hacks. -- [loc 730]<br>
<br>
> Dont et sw1 decide whats on your.mimd -- [loc 732]<br>
<br>
* let’s imagine someone had convinced the American aviation authorities to install bulletproof cockpit doors and locks into planes, thereby avoiding an attack like that of 11 September 2001. Not a single journalist would have reported on this person or their brilliant idea. -- [loc 738]<br>
<br>
> Negativity bias in the news -- [loc 740]<br>
<br>
* Unfortunately, journalists are prone to yet another misconception. They confuse ‘absent’ with ‘unimportant’. Sometimes it’s precisely what’s absent – what hasn’t happened – that is relevant. The absence of inflation, for example, although we’ve been expecting it for ten years. -- [loc 745]<br>
<br>
> Bias against viciously foghting abscence -- [loc 747]<br>
<br>
* Third, an example of a question that’s too complex for our brains. Will there be a world war in the next twenty years? It’s impossible to say. As a consumer of the news, however, you’re confronted almost daily with some story or other about the escalating tensions between China and the USA. Does that mean a clash between the two major powers is imminent? The only thing we can say for certain is that the likelihood is greater than zero and less than a hundred per cent. The intensity with which the media reports on geopolitical tensions has nothing to do with the actual probability of a world war. -- [loc 768]<br>
<br>
> I feel this is wrong but true of consumer -- [loc 773]<br>
<br>
* ‘You are at liberty not to form opinions about all and sundry, thereby sparing your soul unrest. For the things themselves demand no judgements from you.’ -- [loc 786]<br>
<br>
> Is being well inforned good? -- [loc 788]<br>
<br>
* ‘What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.’ -- [loc 810]<br>
<br>
> Alpha of reading books Is lack of distraction and attfwntion fatigue -- [loc 811]<br>
<br>
* This is why workdays when you consume a lot of news are so unsatisfying, even without the wasted time: you can barely get anything else done. -- [loc 823]<br>
<br>
> Can relate... Tired after not focusing on training -- [loc 824]<br>
<br>
* Since you will inevitably lose your battle with the news websites, the only rational strategy is to avoid the battlefield entirely: don’t visit news websites. Why would you give these companies valuable minutes of your life, your urgently needed willpower and your personal data merely to get nonsense and advertising in return? Sounds like a pretty bad deal! The news is mental pollution. Keep your brain clean. It’s your most important organ. -- [loc 824]<br>
<br>
> Twitter BBC Facebook -- [loc 827]<br>
<br>
* Quite simply, news makes the already rather brutal natural hierarchy even more brutal by reporting disproportionately on the beautiful and successful. It functions like a magnifying glass. -- [loc 920]<br>
<br>
> Is this not the hard truth? -- [loc 921]<br>
<br>
* Hardly anything you hear on the news will be something you can change. The daily litany of things we cannot change makes us passive. The -- [loc 941]<br>
<br>
> Quite true -- [loc 943]<br>
<br>
* When our brains encounter information without us having the possibility of acting on it, we gradually assume the role of a victim. -- [loc 946]<br>
<br>
> Possibly -- [loc 947]<br>
<br>
* They became shy, passive, and had a reduced sex drive. They showed signs of anhedonia (a reduced capacity to feel joy), an aversion to new things and a fear of ambiguity. -- [loc 955]<br>
<br>
> 2015-18 -- [loc 956]<br>
<br>
* behave passively towards our family and our jobs as well – precisely where we do have room for manoeuvre. -- [loc 961]<br>
<br>
> I am v guilty of that -- [loc 963]<br>
<br>
* ‘For every reporter in the United States, there are more than four public relations specialists working hard to get them to write what their bosses want them to say,’ -- [loc 1008]<br>
<br>
> That is a big big deal no? -- [loc 1009]<br>
<br>
* So before I read a book or a long article, I take a few minutes and force myself to come up with my own ideas about the issue under discussion. It’s laborious but valuable, because I know that as soon as I start reading, the author’s thoughts will fill my brain, and I’ll have little chance of forming my own. -- [loc 1047]<br>
<br>
> Couple this with notes from the book. Maybe work on a template and a place to keep them -- [loc 1049]<br>
<br>
* If you really want to go fishing in a different pond, set aside half a day per month and go to a large bookshop. Flick through the new publications from as many areas as possible. And yes, buy a few of them. But don’t spend every day surfing random news sites in the hopes of stumbling across a creative idea that will catapult your career to greater heights. -- [loc 1063]<br>
<br>
> Or maybe MR? -- [loc 1066]<br>
<br>
* ‘Slowly you realise. Nothing new,’ wrote playwright Max Frisch about the media. An eternal diagnosis. -- [loc 1073]<br>
<br>
> Possibly true -- [loc 1073]<br>
<br>
* Sturgeon’s Law in mind and stoically accept it, you’ll have a better life. -- [loc 1109]<br>
<br>
> 90pc of any genre is bollocks -- [loc 1109]<br>
<br>
* response is as follows: but should I? I’m sure there are bad things happening on other continents or even other planets. Should I also ‘take an interest’ in that? Where do we draw the line? Tellingly, the media will report exhaustively on a light-aircraft crash in which a few people from the publication’s own country died, but hardly at all on a comparable crash affecting a hundred times more people from, say, Kamchatka. -- [loc 1119]<br>
<br>
> Boo is correct on this -- [loc 1122]<br>
<br>
* By following, say, the fate of earthquake victims on a news website, you’re actually giving your attention to the people running the platform, not the victims themselves. Your attention won’t make a blind bit of difference to the victims, but it certainly will to the platforms. -- [loc 1125]<br>
<br>
> How many things is this true of -- [loc 1127]<br>
<br>
* News and comments about the news bring out the worst in humanity. Keep an airtight seal between yourself and this incubator of negativity, abandoning the hopelessly infected to the virus. -- [loc 1200]<br>
<br>
> Airgap the.mind -- [loc 1201]<br>
<br>
* Consuming the news is like a frantic, never-ending journey. ‘When a person spends all his time in foreign travel,’ noted Seneca, ‘he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends.’ -- [loc 1221]<br>
<br>
> Oooo damn...FOCUS -- [loc 1222]<br>
<br>
* The news industry is society’s appendix – permanently inflamed and completely pointless. You’re better off simply having it removed. -- [loc 1263]<br>
<br>
> Thats a bar -- [loc 1264]<br>
<br>
* Back to the present day. How should we vote sensibly without the news? My recommendation: look first at what the candidates have achieved and only then at what they’ve promised. -- [loc 1282]<br>
<br>
> Achievments then promises -- [loc 1284]<br>
<br>
* Thanks are due to Koni -- [loc 1471]<br>
