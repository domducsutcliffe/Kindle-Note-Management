| **Initial Thoughts** | I would say I was already mostly convinced that the utility of most news was negative. I did indeed think that 'news' as a genre, particularly online, social media and radio acquired news was unentertaining entertainment. I would say I had the opinion that if something was important I'd most likely either hear about it by WoM or in a book with a couple of years delay. I did not think this opinion was very reputable e.g. it didn't cast me in a good light, or worthy of a manifesto. Hence when I saw Rob read the book I thought it was an interesting that the author made not reading the news a point to make a virtue of.  |

* Over the course of your life you will modify your circle of competence. You may even add extra areas of interest. In these cases, creating a deep knowledge base by reading textbooks and completing online courses, reading long articles and talking to people in the know is imperative. -- [loc 446]
